# resume

A more compact version of [sb2nov/resume](https://github.com/sb2nov/resume).

## Preview

```sh
pdflatex main.tex
```

## FontAwesome Preview

I compiled `awesome.tex` on Overleaf to bypass issues with fontawesome imports on xelatex on my older OS setup, and to avoid spacing problems between xelatex and pdflatex.
